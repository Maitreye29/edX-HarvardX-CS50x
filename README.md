# HarvardX CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets in [Harvard's CS50x course on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).

 > This is CS50x, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.
